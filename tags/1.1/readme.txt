Security plugin protects WordPress against Brute force hacks.

== Description ==
It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress back-end.

= Brute-force attacks =
Brute-force attack is an exhaustive password search to get full access to an Administrator account. Passwords are not the hard part for hackers taking into account the quantity of sent password variants per second and the big amount of IP-addresses.

Brute-force attack is one of the most dangerous attacks as an intruder gets full access to your website and can change your code. Consequences of these break-ins might be grievous, your website could be added to the [botnet] and it could participate in attacks to other websites, it could be used to keep hidden links or automatic redirection to a suspicious website. Consequences for your website reputation might be very grievous.

= Anti Brute-force security =
The plugin is effective — it doesn't load the server, doesn't enquire the database and doesn't create any tables. It doesn't put anything in ".htaccess" as it could have a negative effect on your website accessibility or block the access to Administrator profile.
The plugin takes optimal delay time between login attempts when a user corrects his credentials and tries to log in again. These seconds are more than enough for a user. If a user didn't make it in time — he can always retry and the delayed time will be nullified.

It drops the effectiveness of brute-force attacks. A bot spends milliseconds to submit passwords, but the plugin allows to do it once in several seconds. If a bot needed a few months to find correct password, the protection prolongs the time to several years.

= TODO =
