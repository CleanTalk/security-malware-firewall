Malware always becomes a headache for site owners. If you don’t regularly check for malware, it will be able to work insensibly a lot of time and damage your reputation. If you prevent malware attacks before they happen, you will be able to save your resources.

What is malware and why does it matter to your business? Malware is malicious code that performs actions for hackers. If your site has been infected with malware it will be able a problem for customer trust and their personal details.

First, you need to scan your site to confirm the malware exists. The next step you should fix all files with malware.

= Limit Login Attempts =  
Limit Login Attempts - is a part of brute-force protection and security firewall. Each time, when login/pass was wrong, plugin set the first timeout for 5 attempts within 3 sec, for next attempts timeout will be set to 10 sec. 

Security Firewall has a limit for requests to your website (by default 1000 requests per hour, so you can change it) and if any IP exceed this threshold it will be added to security firewall for next 24 hours. It allows you to break some of the DDoS attacks. 

= Brute Force Protection =

It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress admin area. WordPress Security & Firewall by CleanTalk makes access to your website more secure. Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in per hour, then these IP’s will be banned for next 24 hours.

*Security Audit Log* keeps track of actions in the WP Dashboard to let you know what is happening on your blog.
With the Security Audit Log is very easy to see user activity in order to understand what changes have done and who made them.
Security Audit Log shows who logged in and when and how much time they spent on each page.

= Security Traffic Control =
CleanTalk security Traffic Control will track every single visitor no matter if they are using JavaScript or not and provides many valuable traffic parameters. 

Another option in Security Traffic Control - "Block user after requests amounts more than" - blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. The number of requests can be set in the settings, the default is 1000. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the FireWall Black List for 24 hours. This is an effective measure against DoS attacks and reduces a load on your web server.

= Security Firewall =
To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.

BlackIPs Database — is the database of the most active IP addresses where massive spam and brute force attacks come from. When IP starts attacking a few websites they are immediately added to the blacklist. IPs that stop attacking are being removed over time and that time is relatively short — usually about 2 weeks.

Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.

= Security Malware Scanner =
Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.

Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.

If any files have changed in your WordPress system you will be able to delete them or restore the original WP files.

CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions. 

= Checking Outbound Links =
Outbound links have an effect on your SEO and when search crawls your web pages all of the outbound links may be an important thing for page ranking.

This option allows you to let know the number of outgoing links from your website and websites on which they linking to. All websites will be checked by our Database and will show results if they were used as links in spam messages. it allows you to check your website and find hidden links or spam links.

You should always remember if you have links to other websites which have a bad reputation, it will be able to have an effect your on visitor's trust and your SEO. 

= Malware Heuristic Check =
This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.

The core files are files that go with WordPress distributive. Any other PHP files laying in WordPress directory (except /wp-content/) are unknown and should be properly scanned. Even if we found something in these files they will also show up in the Unknown category to let you know that they are third-party files.

Every file in /wp-content/* will be checked with a heuristic. And the check can find many interesting. If you see there many finds, don't panic, it shows you only possible weak spots.

Malware Heuristic analyses the code by simplifying it and looks for suspicious functions and constructs which are usually used by hackers. For example eval construct http://php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php and much other suspicious stuff.

= Brute Force security for Wordpress =

Brute force attack is an exhaustive password search to get full access to an Administrator account. Passwords are not the hard part for hackers taking into account the quantity of sent password variants per second and the big amount of IP-addresses.

Brute force attack is one of the most security issues as an intruder gets full access to your website and can change your code. Consequences of these break-ins might be grievous, your website could be added to the [botnet] and it could participate in attacks to other websites, it could be used to keep hidden links or automatic redirection to a suspicious website. Consequences for your website reputation might be very grievous.
