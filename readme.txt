Security FireWall by CleanTalk is a free plugin which works with the premium Cloud security service cleantalk.org. This security plugin as a service https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service.

Malware always becomes a headache for site owners. If you don’t regularly check for malware, it will be able to work insensibly a lot of time and damage your reputation. If you prevent malware attacks before they happen, you will be able to save your resources.

What is malware and why does it matter to your business? Malware is malicious code that performs actions for hackers. If your site has been infected with malware it will be able a problem for customer trust and their personal details.

First, you need to scan your site to confirm the malware exists. The next step you should fix all files with malware.

= Limit Login Attempts =
Limit Login Attempts - is a part of brute-force protection and security firewall. 

Security Firewall has a limit for requests to your website (by default 1000 requests per hour, so you can change it) and if any IP exceed this threshold it will be added to security firewall for next 24 hours. It allows you to break some of the DDoS attacks.

= Brute Force Protection =

It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress admin area. WordPress Security & Firewall by CleanTalk makes access to your website more secure. Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in per hour, then these IP’s will be banned for next 24 hours.

*Security Audit Log* keeps track of actions in the WP Dashboard to let you know what is happening on your blog.
With the Security Audit Log is very easy to see user activity in order to understand what changes have done and who made them.
Security Audit Log shows who logged in and when and how much time they spent on each page.

= Security Traffic Control =
CleanTalk security Traffic Control will track every single visitor no matter if they are using JavaScript or not and provides many valuable traffic parameters.

Another option in Security Traffic Control - "Block user after requests amounts more than" - blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the Security FireWall Black List for 24 hours. 

= Security Firewall =
To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk Security FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.

Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.

CleanTalk Security is fully compatible with the most popular VPN services.
Also, CleanTalk security supports all search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, MSN, Yandex and etc.

= Security Malware Scanner =
Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.

Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your Security CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.

CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions.

CleanTalk Security has a "Feedback System" for analyzing suspicious files. This is the client-server feature in CleanTalk Security that allows sending suspicious files from the WordPress backend to CleanTalk cloud.

Security Malware Scanner shows a list of suspicious files and you can view code that was indicated as bad. If you don’t have programming experience and don’t know, is there security issue or not, you will be able to send some files to CleanTalk and we will check them for malware code. After checking we will send you an email notification with results, is there viruses or not.

Every day, CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner will check new files and files that have been changed from the last scanning. 

Please, look at our guide How malware file analysis works.
[About Scanner Feedback System](https://cleantalk.org/help/files-analysis "About Scanner Feedback System")

= Checking Outbound Links =
This option allows you to let know the number of outgoing links from your website and websites on which they linking to. it allows you to check your website and find hidden links or spam links.


= Security Malware Heuristic Check =
This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.

= Security Malware scanner to find SQL Injections =
The CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner allows you to find code that allows performing SQL injection. It is this problem that the scanner solves.

= CleanTalk Web Application FireWall for WordPress Security Plugin =

The main purpose of Security Web Application FireWall is to protect the Web application from unauthorized access, even if there are critical vulnerabilities.

Security Web Application FireWall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorised users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.

In addition to effective information security and information security applications are required to know what is quality of protection and CleanTalk Security has logged all blocked requests that allow you to know and analyze accurate information. You can see your Cleantalk Security Logs in your Control panel. https://cleantalk.org/my/logs_firewall

Security CleanTalk Web Application FireWall for WordPress is the proactive defense against known and unknown vulnerabilities to prevent hacks in real-time.

= Improve your website security with Two Factor Authentication =
It requires a bit of your time but Two Factor (2 Step) Authentication immediately gives a much higher level of security.

With your first authorization, the CleanTalk Security plugin remembers your browser and you won’t have to input your authorization code every time anymore. However, if you started to use a new device or a new browser then you are required to input your security authorization code. CleanTalk security plugin will remember your browser for 30 days.

= Change the URL of the wp-login page =

This option helps you change the default wp-login URL. Hackers use scripts for massive brute-force attacks, and since most sites use a default login page URL, hackers configure scripts for such URLs. When you change the URL of the authorization page, hackers will not have the opportunity to perform brute-force attacks in scripts in automatic mode.

To enable the option, go to the WP Dashboard plugin settings -> Settings -> Security by CleanTalk -> General Settings and check box Change address to login script. Then add a new URL and click Save Settings.
This option does not change files and does not rewrite URLs in system files. To return the address of the default authorization page, it is enough to disable the option in the plugin settings or set a new value.

If you are using caching plugins, then you need to add a new authorization page in the caching exceptions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does malware scanner work? =
Malware scanner will check and compare with the original WP files and show you what files were changed, deleted or added. Malware scanner could be used to find an added code in WP files. On your Malware Security Log page, you will see the list of all scans that were performed for your website. The CleanTalk Cloud saves the list of the found files for you to know where to look them for.

= How to start malware scanner? =
At the moment malware scanner may be started one time per day and manually.
To start malware scanner go to the WordPress Admin Page —> Settings —> Security by CleanTalk —> "Malware Scanner" tab —> Perform Scan.
Give the Malware Scanner some time to check all necessary files on your website.

= Is it free or paid? =
The plugin is free. But the plugin uses CleanTalk cloud security service. You have to register an account and then you will receive a free trial to test. When the trial (on CleanTalk account) is finished, you can renew the subscription for 1 year or deactivate the Security by CleanTalk plugin.
If you haven’t got access key, the plugin will work and you will have logs only on the plugin settings page for last 20 requests.

= What happens after the end of the trial period? =
The plugin will fully perform its functions after the end of the trial period and will protect your website from brute force attacks and will keep Action Log in your WP Dashboard, but the number of entries in the log will be limited to the last 20 entries/24 hours. Also, you will receive a short daily security report to your email.

Premium version allows to storage all logs for 45 days in the CleanTalk Dashboard for further analysis.

= Email Notifications when administrators are logged in =

Do you want to receive a notice each time a user with administrator rights is logged into the WP Dashboard?

We added this option to our security plugin. Now you can receive notifications if you want to know about an unauthorized entrance to your WP Dashboard.

Notification will be sent only when a user was able to authorize entering login and password. If you are logged into the admin panel from the saved session, then the alert won’t be sent.

You can enable the option “Receive notifications for admin authorizations in your CleanTalk Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu, then click “Settings”.

= Can CleanTalk Security protect from DDoS? =

Security FireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, Security FireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. If your website under DDoS attack you will be able to add IPs to your personal BlackList to block all Post and GET requests.

= Brute Force security for Wordpress =

Brute force attack is an exhaustive password search to get full access to an Administrator account. Passwords are not the hard part for hackers taking into account the quantity of sent password variants per second and the big amount of IP-addresses.

Brute force attack is one of the most security issues as an intruder gets full access to your website and can change your code. Consequences of these break-ins might be grievous, your website could be added to the [botnet] and it could participate in attacks to other websites, it could be used to keep hidden links or automatic redirection to a suspicious website. Consequences for your website reputation might be very grievous.
